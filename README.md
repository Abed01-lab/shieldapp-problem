# Interested in working for shield as a fullstack developer?

Give us a chance to see your beautiful code! ü§© 

How to get started:
- Fork this repository
- Use [Nx](https://nx.dev/) to generate a small application with [Angular](https://angular.io/) + [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/)
- Setup [Ant Design for Angular](https://ng.ant.design/docs/introduce/en)
- Create a **simple online basket** that utilizes the components from the UI framework
- Describe your design decisions and setup instructions in the README.md of the forked repository

The application should contain the following features:
1. Show a list of products fetched from a database
3. Enable users to add and delete products from a basket
4. Save the basket contents in a database

There are no other hard requirements than that ‚Äî take a look at the [Wireframes](#wireframes) for inspiration.

## FAQ
- **Should I use a real database like Postgres to store the information or can I simply store it in a variable?**
    - We would like to see how you work with databases and relations, and thus we would prefer if you persisted the information. We provide a `docker-compose.yml` file that will run a PostgreSql database for you
- **How long should it take me to complete the assignment?**
    - It should take you less than 8 hours but it depends on your Typescript wizard magic skills ü™Ñ
- **What about tests?**
    - Tests with [Jest](https://jestjs.io/), E2E using [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) and [supertest](https://github.com/visionmedia/supertest) are heavily used here at @shieldapp so it won't hurt if you include them üòé 
- **Any extra fluff I could include?**
    - We don't want to force anyone to spend their weekend on a job application, but if you feel like making this project something more, we would love to see features like deployment, [swaggerUi documentation](https://docs.nestjs.com/openapi/introduction), or [continous integration workflows](https://github.com/features/actions) üëå
